snes-sdk
========

From https://code.google.com/p/snes-sdk/:
SNES-SDK is a C toolchain and libraries targeting 65816 systems, specifically the Super NES (aka Super Nintendo, Super Famicom). It consists of a version of TCC equipped with a 65816 code generator and modified versions of WLA-DX (assembler and linker) and SNES9x (emulator for running the test suite). It is extremely hacky and very unpolished, but it passes a substantial part of the GCC test suite and even has floating-point support. It also comes with a version of the demo game for the SNES pseudo-C compiler SNESC which has been translated to proper C.

From me:
Looks like a pretty good start for coding up homebrew stuff with the peace of mind of NOT coding in assembly. We will see what is the state of this project.
